EXPRESSION / POSE: [neutral, smiling, relaxed, unposed].

Natural LIGHT DIRECTION: [window light / side light / ambient daylight] designed to reveal texture, not hide it. Neutral color science, realistic contrast, no artificial smoothing or beauty correction. Shot on LENS: [smartphone / 50–85mm / macro], realistic depth of field. Photographed in a CAMERA FEEL: smartphone photography, at CAMERA LEVEL: [eye level / slight up / extreme close-up], with organic sharpness, micro-contrast, slight digital grain, and natural color rendering. The image should feel real, imperfect, human, and unretouched — like a genuine smartphone photo, not AI-generated, not polished.
